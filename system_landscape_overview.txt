# System Landscape Overview

This document provides a simple, non-technical explanation of the websites, systems, and tools that power our e-commerce platform. Think of this as a complete map of our digital city.

## 1. The User Facing Experience (The Storefronts)
These are the parts of the system that regular people (shoppers, admins) see and interact with.

*   **storefront-service (The Public Shop)**: The main website where customers browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases.
*   **landing-service (The Marketing Page)**: A specialized page designed for marketing campaigns (ads) to welcome new visitors.
*   **admin-backoffice-service (The Command Center)**: A private website for employees to manage products, view sales, and control the system.

## 2. The Managers (Core Business Logic)
These services act like managers behind the scenes, making business decisions.

*   **api-gateway (The Front Desk)**: The single entry point. It checks IDs (security) and directs visitors to the right department.
*   **auth-service (The Security Guard)**: Handles logins and signups, verifying who users are.
*   **offer-service (The Catalog Manager)**: Manages the product catalog (descriptions, prices, images).
*   **user-service (The Customer Records)**: Manages customer profiles and settings.
*   **cart-service (The Shopping Assistant)**: Remembers what items a customer is carrying before checkout.
*   **redirect-service (The Traffic Director)**: Handles special links (like affiliate links) and tracks who sent the visitor.
*   **feature-flag-service (The Switchboard)**: Allows us to turn new features on/off instantly without stopping the site.

## 3. The Listeners (Analytics & Tracking)
We need to know what's happening to improve the store. These services record everything.

*   **analytics-ingest-service (The Scribe)**: Rapidly records clicks and page views in real-time.
*   **conversion-webhook (The Sales Recorder)**: Listens for "payment success" messages from banks/payment providers.
*   **attribution-service (The Detective)**: Calculates which ad or link gets credit for a sale.

## 4. The Messengers & Notifications
*   **notification-service (The Postman)**: Sends emails, SMS, or push notifications to users.
*   **audit-service (The Compliance Officer)**: Keeps a permanent, unchangeable log of sensitive actions (e.g., "Price changed").
*   **reporting-service (The Analyst)**: Crunches numbers to generate business reports.

## 5. The Infrastructure (The Foundation)
These are the invisible technologies that keep the application running.

*   **GKE / Kubernetes (The Operating System)**: The platform that manages all services, keeping them healthy and scaling them.
*   **Kafka (The Central Nervous System)**: A messaging system that lets services talk to each other instantly (e.g., Sale -> Send Email).
*   **PostgreSQL (The Filing Cabinet)**: The main database for long-term records (users, products).
*   **Redis (The Short-Term Memo)**: Super-fast memory for temporary things like user sessions.
*   **Istio (The Traffic Police)**: Manages network traffic, adding security and preventing traffic jams.
*   **Terraform (The Blueprints)**: Code that automatically builds our cloud servers (GCP) so we don't have to click buttons manually.

## 6. Observability (The Health Monitors)
These tools act like a hospital monitoring system.

*   **Prometheus (The Vitals Monitor)**: Measures CPU, memory, and speed. Triggers alarms if something breaks.
*   **Grafana (The Dashboard)**: Visual charts and graphs for engineers to check system health.
*   **Loki (The Black Box Recorder)**: Collects logs (text diaries) from every service for debugging.
*   **Tempo (The Tracer)**: Follows a single request across the entire system to find where it failed.

## 7. The Laboratory (Code Quality & Testing)
Tools we use to ensure our code is good before it goes live.

*   **SonarQube (The Inspector)**: Automatically scans our code to find bugs and security holes.
*   **GitHub Actions (The Assembly Line)**: Our automation robot. When we save code, it automatically runs tests and checks quality.

## 8. The Utility Belt (Shared Tools)
*   **services/shared-lib (The Toolset)**: A collection of common code used by multiple services (like logging, error handling) so we don't repeat ourselves.
*   **scripts/ (The Maintenance Crew)**: A folder of small programs used by engineers to fix things, upgrade software, or deploy updates.
